# Chirpy!

*Hello World*, this is the first entry in my new blog! My goal is to make at least weekly entries, talking about what I've been working on either in work or in side projects. This is really meant to keep me accountable and excited about learning, but if someone else can learn from something I do then that's pretty cool too.

## What is Chirpy?

Today wasn't all that impressive - starting this blog. I used a github template called [chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) which is a wrapper around jekyll. Basically this gives me a pre styled website (deployed for free with github pages) which I can add posts to by writing markdown documents.
This was super easy to set up, all in all it took about half an hour to install the prerequisites, fill out the initial configuration, and push up the updated branch. 

## Other work today

I spent a good chunk of time reviewing Kubernetes basics and architecture, in preparation to eventually take the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam. Most of this review was trying to reorganize my thoughts and notes into a [mind map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map). I'm still kind of figuring out mind maps, but from what I've heard and researched (mostly from Justin Sung on Youtube) they can hugely improve your retention of information, and make quick review so much easier. So far I feel like this is really helping but takes a ton of time, I'm not sure how much of that is due to me being slow though.

I've also been learning how to use [bluetoothctl](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bluetooth). More on this tomorrow (probably?) but I've been wanting to transition back down to 1 external monitor rather than three, and I'm not sure how well I can do that with the workspace tooling that PopOS offers. Long story short, I'm looking to switch to using the i3 window manager, but will need a way to manage bluetooth devices (keyboard, earbuds, mouse, etc) without the gnome bluetooth manager in PopOS' settings.

## Plans and Current Projects

As kind of stated above, I'm hoping to transition over to i3 tonight/tomorrow. The main kink I think I still need to work through is managing workspaces on my laptop screen vs the external monitor.

Other projects:
- Studying for CKA Exam
  - I've got about 8 general sections I plan on getting basic maps for to review, and then would like to go through some practice tests/pet projects to prep for this.
- [Go and HTMX](https://github.com/BoweFlex/go-htmx)
  - I've set this up to use tailwind (this project so far deserves a couple posts) and would like to create a home page and then work on some more subpaths for this project.
- Talos
  - I'll also try to make a post on this later, I've been playing with talos for deploying/managing k8s clusters and want to mess with it more.
